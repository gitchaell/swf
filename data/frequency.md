# Wave Frequency in Everyday Human Life

**By Charles Ferreira de Souza – March 2013**

Wave frequency is present in every human being from the moment they are born. It is generated by their Soul Flame (*Alma Chama*), which, by generating a pulse, activates it so that physically it begins to "build" its history here—its memory. Therefore, as the human being "goes on" with their life, their wave frequency records all the moments of their daily life. It records their emotions, their feelings, etc., and with them, their memory is built, while at the same time showing their character, their way of being.

Through this vibrational record, beings from parallel realities are able to identify the wave frequency of each individual, with everything they are, with everything they have done, and what they are doing. With everything that is the reason for their current life.

In fact, the wave frequency is not just the record that identifies someone in the reality of the 3rd dimension of Earth; it also "makes itself" known as their true cosmic identity, as their true vibrational and universal form, which shows itself in the here and now.

When a person has their wave frequency taken for the second time, it may come out with some "vibrational distortion," therefore with one symbol or another not showing itself as in the original wave frequency, which is shown by the Ultras in digital photos.

Sometimes it is also difficult to take it if the frequency of a group of people is not aligned, which requires adjusting it until all the people who compose it are harmonized and the Ultras (who show themselves "blinking") can bring the wave frequency of each one well-defined in their body.

The wave frequency is of total importance to the person because through it changes regarding their life are possible.

As the human being experiences events in their day-to-day life, they are generating positive or negative vibrational frequencies. For the latter, they must maintain constant vigilance, with their thoughts and behaviors directed toward balance.

The wave frequency is the signaler for each one. The one who has already taken it already has their energy field registered by it, vibrating in tune with it. Therefore, if someone thoughtlessly is in an inadvisable place or intends to have an incorrect attitude, both the Ultras can warn them (if they have peripheral vision), and their wave frequency can also warn them, causing a momentary and inexplicable malaise, which directs them (intuitively) to leave that place or to take other attitudes.

But, for the one who, due to their uncontained anger, their uncontrollable envy, among other attitudes that generate the "fourth path," remains fully conscious with purposes in these highly negative frequencies, the beings no longer have the condition to help them, nor does their wave frequency interfere anymore in a vibrationally positive way so that they change their way of thinking and proceeding.

On the other hand, when someone takes their wave frequency, there is the possibility that they become vibrationally more active, allowing the beings (Ultras) to be more present in their energy field, therefore directly acting, acting, and directing within it.

Each one must keep in their mind the record (drawing) of their wave frequency, because by visualizing it, they have more ease (through it) to remember the positive things they have already done—and that they have already learned. If they do not have the facility to memorize, let them carry it drawn on a paper and visualize it in this way.

Since everything in Project Portal is associated with the mental and the vibrational, it is necessary to do both physical exercises (for the body) and the other exercises (for the mind) that have already been passed on. One must also follow the guidelines already given for a healthy diet and, above all, lead a life with as little stress and depression as possible.

It is necessary for each one to think about their life in a practical way, taking care of daily chores without the interference of fanatical procedures that make them forget the world, but at the same time without ceasing to proceed aiming for a more conscious life, of more inner growth.

Sometimes someone can enter a type of paranoia. Led by annoyances in day-to-day coexistence, they end up transferring their annoyance to a procedure that aims to forget everything positive they have learned. Letting themselves be carried away more and more by "he said, she said," they enter an acute process of anguish and sadness, which can lead them to depression, already in the form of psychosomatic illness.

At this moment, to not reach "rock bottom," their Will must prevail so that they act. They must remember what they have already learned (in the readings they have already done or in what they have already heard) and activate their energy field through techniques they already know.

They must turn it around, opening their energy field even more, becoming more productive, more positive, even if they do not yet totally believe in everything that is at their disposal as information. At this moment, the visualization of their wave frequency is indispensable, giving a click in their memory and rescuing what is in it as their positive learning—as their positive pattern, to help them.

The human being is programmed to experience the negative, for what is already programmed (by the GO) in their mind. It is common to blame others when they are in this frequency and cannot get up.

The wave frequency puts the human being face to face with themselves and also makes them the mirror of their neighbor, allowing each one to understand the other as they are—each one with their differences. With the wave frequency, one manages to feel the good not only in one or some people but in all people.

Perceiving the Whole, thinking and acting in relation to it, this is proceeding in resonance with the wave frequency. It is generating active energetic repercussions when everyone (conscious) is acting. They are like a Unity in motion.

The wave frequency, being essentially vibration—energy, allows the person to feel what vibration is, to understand what frequency is.

For the one who is in tune with their wave frequency, it does not allow them to transform into a negative walking frequency, generating and receiving negative energies wherever they go, but rather to remain in a harmonic frequency, which reminds and imitates Francis of Assisi when he said:

*"Lord: Make me an instrument of your Peace.*
*Where there is Hatred, let me sow Love,*
*Where there is Injury, Pardon.*
*Where there is Discord, Union.*
*Where there is Doubt, Faith.*
*Where there is Error, Truth.*
*Where there is Despair, Hope.*
*Where there is Sadness, Joy.*
*Where there is Darkness, Light!"*

All those who consciously seek to be in resonance with their wave frequency should also seek to vibrate in the frequency of the prayer of Francis of Assisi.

The one who always carries harmony wherever they pass, in this positive pattern, manages to make things go well not only for themselves but also for others.

Project Portal allows everyone to have a good energetic baggage through very good content of information, which, when well used, generates a wonderful situation because the person returns to themselves and can grow together with others.

Before doubting, one must experiment. Study and practice (train). It is more intelligent to "pay to see." One must observe, have a critical sense open to new ideas, so that this information fits with what one already has.

One should not close the channels of Knowledge, because if any of them is closed in the belief that certain information is true, others that could be more enlightening and even complement those that the seeker already has, their effort remains halfway, and with this, they also remain halfway.

After acquiring new knowledge (after studying it), the person must experiment with the techniques if by chance this new knowledge asks for this, to then improve them if applicable.

The important thing is always to seek to have a new view of the world, to learn to perceive the diversity of things. Do not value that information that insists on being old and that, being also castrating, generates the armor through which nothing enters and nothing lets one experience.

To experience with parallel realities, there must be an open mind, feeling the heart full of "something" positive. One must prepare to experience a good thing and feel a pleasant sensation.

Interacting with parallel realities is having a truer feeling, despite people asking "what reality" is the one the human being is experiencing.

Unfortunately, experiencing "the real" of a world in which the media is constantly bringing information that depresses. Information that portrays the reality of this physical world ruled by attitudes of hatred, violence, and misery in every sense. And the worst of all is that people are already becoming increasingly insensitive to this entire situation.

The one who already has knowledge of their wave frequency must not enter in tune with this global human madness. They must look inside themselves and, without letting themselves be contaminated, enter a vibrational frequency of their own so that it gives a "click" and changes the focus, investing in their growth.

Even if physically in the middle of this global human madness, may their mind not be. They must increase their conscience pattern (level 19), but for this, they must raise their vibrational frequency.

The vibrational frequency is the sum of all of someone's daily procedures. It is the result of how they proceed at home, at work, and on the street. But, mainly, it is how they act in relation to themselves. The sum of all this gives them the number on the Conscience Scale, which is related to the vibrational frequencies generated by them.

Using this vibrational "vision," they must avail themselves of a broader perception, which being also deeper and at the same time more distant, isolates them from these negative energies (not from the people).

May they "think big" and act in this way, but always turned toward themselves and their fellows, because possessing a gigantic star in their hearts, all are really similar, only possessors of different frequencies.

As each one is responsible for themselves, each one must play their part, knowing how to play well in the great game of life. They must conduct themselves with balance within a right measure so that things can also flow correctly, without any possibility that they enter the fourth path through excessive and even fanatical conduct. Therefore, if they are in a high conscience pattern, keep it, not getting irritated, not getting disharmonized.

If someone has to change the direction of their life, let them change, but little by little probing what they can do at the moment, without running over things and without complaints. And whenever possible, keep in mind their wave frequency, because with this visualization, recalling some past positive experiences, they can act as references to help them at this moment.
