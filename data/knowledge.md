# Dakila Research: Symbology and Frequencies

## Introduction
Dakila Pesquisas explores the relationship between geometric shapes (symbology) and wave frequencies.

## Key Findings
- **Curves** often represent organic, fluid frequencies.
- **Straight lines** may indicate structured, artificial, or high-intensity frequencies.
- The interaction between these forms creates a resonance pattern that can be analyzed.

## Methodology
The analysis compares visual inputs against a database of known frequency responses.
